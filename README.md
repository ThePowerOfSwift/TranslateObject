## Translate Object

 'Translate Object' is an iOS app written in Swift that utilizes Core Machine Learning and the Resnet50 Convolutional Neural Network model to identify objects in the mobile device's live camera feed in real-time. The name of the object is then translated to a foreign language of the user's choice in real-time via a Google Cloud Services API. The user can switch languages at any time while using the app. The native language is set to the user's mobile device preference.
